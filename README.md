# Audio Style Transfer with CNNs

This is an implementation of the paper [A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) as well as [vadim-v-levbedev's code](https://github.com/vadim-v-lebedev/audio_style_tranfer) using Tensorflow.


The songs tested were Circle of Life from The Lion King soundtrack, and All My Life by the Foo Fighters. Both of these songs have a similar BPM and key. This implementation can run on CPU only.
The results can be summed up by the image output below:
